<h2>What Are NFT Coins and How Do They Work? Hint: They Arenâ€™t NFTs.</h2>
NFT currencies, which are not to be confused with NFTs themselves, are any cryptocurrency coins that are used to sustain NFT ecosystems. For example, Axie Infinity is an NFT blockchain game that makes use of its native currency, AXS, to support staking and voting in order to keep the play-to-earn economy running smoothly. As a result, AXS is the NFT currency for Axie Infinity. NFT currencies like as AXS, SLP, and SAND assist decentralised apps with a range of critical services, ranging from serving as an in-game money to allowing users to cast ballots in elections. NFT coins, like any other cryptocurrency, may be traded or invested in just like any other.

Because NFT coins are fungible, they vary from NFTs in the most significant sense. Non-fungible tokens, also known as non-fungible tokens, represent ownership rights to unique digital or real-world assets, whereas fungible tokens, also known as fungible coins, represent ownership rights to fungible assets that can be traded or exchanged for another non-fungible token of the same value. As previously said, NFT coins are the token currencies that serve as the fuel for the economies of NFT initiatives.

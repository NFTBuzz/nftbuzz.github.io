<h2>What Are Ethereum Gas Fees?</h2>
All users must pay a gas price in order to execute any operation on the Ethereum network.
<h3>Beginner</h3>
There is no such thing as a free lunch, and no such thing as a free transaction. If paying $5 to get $20 from an ATM is inconvenient, consider spending $100 to transfer $500 or receive a PNG of a penguin.

While this may seem to be an extreme example, it is sometimes necessary in order to execute a transaction or perform a function on Ethereum's network. And, unlike ATM costs, the Ethereum network will not reimburse you for your gas expenses at the end of the month.
<h2>What is Gas?</h2>
The quantity of ether (ETH) – the native money of Ethereum – needed by the network for a user to engage with the network is referred to as gas. These fees are designed to reward Ethereum miners for the energy necessary to validate a transaction as well as to provide security to the Ethereum network by making it prohibitively costly for malevolent users to spam the network.

Despite the fact that they are an efficient technique of motivating miners to continue confirming transactions and maintaining network security, gas fees are every user's least favourite aspect of Ethereum. People despise gas costs not simply because they dislike fees in general, but also because they may be exorbitantly costly when the network is crowded.

So, let's take a look at what causes gas costs to be so high and what easy measures you can take to save money while engaging with the Ethereum ecosystem.
<h2>How are Gas Fees Calculated?</h2>
To understand why gas prices are so high and how you might save money on them, you must first grasp how they are calculated.

Because Ethereum costs are normally significantly smaller than one ETH (though it sometimes doesn't seem that way), Ethereum uses a metric system of denominated units called "wei," where one ETH is equivalent to one quintillion wei. (A quintillion is a number followed by 18 zeros.) The gigawei (gwei), or one billion wei, is one of the most popular wei denominations and is used to represent gas taxes. As a result, if you check a gas tracker and observe that the average gas for a transaction is 100 gwei, you may anticipate to pay a base fee of 0.0000001 ETH for a specific transaction ($0.00031 at press time)/

If you've ever generated a non-fungible token or bought one on a secondary market like OpenSea, you may believe 100 gwei is a bargain for an NFT transfer. This is due to the fact that the basic costs are just one component of the overall price structure. Following the new gas cost structures introduced by Ethereum's London update, the total charge is now computed as follows:

Total Fee = Gas unit (limits) * (Base fee + Tip)
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Gas units (limits):</strong> This is the most you're prepared to pay on a transaction in terms of gas. While you may change how much gas your transaction will cost, you must do it with caution. This is due to the fact that various sorts of interactions with the Ethereum blockchain will take varying quantities of gas to complete.</li>
 	<li><strong>Base fee:</strong> The base fee is the smallest amount of gas necessary to include a transaction on the Ethereum network. The desire for a transaction to be included determines the quantity of gas necessary for a basic charge, independent of the kind of transaction. Base fees are constantly modified dependent on the amount of users engaging with the network at any one moment since they are a demand factor.</li>
 	<li><strong>Tips:</strong> Also known as a priority charge, tips are an extra amount paid to expedite the completion of your transaction. This charge is more often referred to as a tip since it offers an economic incentive for Ethereum miners to confirm your transaction before others. When a miner confirms a transaction that includes a priority charge, they get that money as a tip. Because miners can see which transactions have tips attached, they will prioritise finishing transactions with the biggest tips attached in order to earn the most money.</li>
</ul>
It's crucial to remember that if you set your gas unit limit to less than the quantity of gas required to finish your engagement, your transaction will be reversed but you won't get your gas cost back. That's because the miner has already done the comparable amount of labour to complete your transaction, and they get paid even if the transaction fails.

As an example of the total fee formula, suppose I want to send you 1 ETH and the average amount of gas needed to transfer ETH on the Ethereum network is 23,000 gwei. That would be my gas limit. The least quantity of gas necessary to transmit the transaction at the moment (base charge) is 150 gwei, but I want it to reach to you as soon as possible, so I add a 20 gwei tip to the transaction. In this scenario, our total charge formula would be as follows:

Total Fee to send you 1 ETH = 23,000 gwei * (150 gwei + 20 gwei)

Following, the total fee would be equal to 3910000 gwei, or 0.00391 ETH (about $13, at press time). This means that I would send 1.00231 ETH to the Ethereum blockchain and you would receive 1 ETH to go buy some cool JPGs.
<h2>Why gas fees cost so much</h2>
We can comprehend why gas prices are so expensive if we understand how total gas fees are computed. The two main variables that have lately led gas prices to skyrocket are:
<ul>
 	<li>Gas fees denomination in gwei.</li>
 	<li>Ethereum’s variable total fee formula.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Gas fees cost more because ETH costs more</h2>
The first major reason for higher gas fees is simply that ETH is more expensive. Remember that gas costs are denominated in gwei, which is a different method of representing ETH. The thriving decentralised finance (DeFi) and NFT industries, which continue to draw new users to Ethereum's ecosystem, are the primary drivers of this expanding demand.
<h2>Gas fees cost more because base fees cost more</h2>
Furthermore, gas costs are so high right now because Ethereum's total fee formula is dynamic. Remember that basic fees are the very minimum of gas necessary to include a transaction on the Ethereum blockchain, and they are changed based on transaction inclusion demand. As a consequence of rising demand for the Ethereum blockchain, basic fees have continually climbed.

On the Ethereum blockchain, over 3,000 decentralised applications (also known as "dapps") are running, all of which want their transactions to be included alongside those of other Ethereum network users. Dapps alone account for over 100,000 daily active users on Ethereum, doing around 250,000 transactions every day.

The growing use of Ethereum has not only resulted in greater base fees, but also in a far more volatile gas for base fees. To make gas costs more consistent, Ethereum's EIP 1559 update changed the computation of basic fees to be decided by the transaction preceding it. While the true effects of EIP 1559 are being contested, base fees continue to push up the overall cost of gas fees owing to increasing demand for Ethereum.

Ethereum 2.0 is a significant update to the Ethereum network that will see the Ethereum consensus mechanism migrate from proof-of-work (PoW) to proof-of-stake (PoS) (PoS). Among the several advantages to the network, the update aims to put Ethereum costs in line with other market rivals by dramatically boosting transaction-processing capacity and eliminating the need for miners.
<h2>How to spend less on gas</h2>
While it is difficult to avoid paying for gas while utilising the Ethereum blockchain, there are various methods for making it less onerous.
<h3>Pick the right time and be patient</h3>
Unfortunately, there is no method to directly lessen the effect of the gas unit, however you may reduce your overall charge by decreasing the basic fee and tip.

You might make your transaction on the network when there are less individuals using the blockchain to minimise the cost of your total gas charge via a lower base fee. This is because base fees are, in some ways, a measure of demand for Ethereum. When more labour is needed to engage with the Ethereum network, gas prices rise. When there are more users attempting to communicate with the network, more effort is necessary. As a result, if you can locate a period when there is less demand to communicate with the Ethereum network, you may spend less on gas by lowering the transaction's basic price. Weekends are often the ideal time to do so.

Another way to cut your overall gas charge expense is to reduce your tip. Remember that our tip, or priority fee, is a cost that we may charge miners in return for speedier transaction times. If your transaction isn't time-sensitive and you're prepared to wait, lowering your tip might be another option to save money on petrol.
<h3>Set a max fee limit on your transaction</h3>
Setting a maximum gas charge restriction on your transaction is another approach to save money on gas costs. Setting a maximum gas cost tells the Ethereum blockchain that X gwei is the most you're ready to pay by sending X gwei as your total gas fee. Once the transaction has been completed, the Ethereum network will return the remaining portion of the maximum charge that was not utilised as part of your total gas cost.

Setting maximum fees might not only help you save money on petrol, but it can also give you piece of mind that you will not be spending more than necessary on a certain transaction. However, as with establishing your gas limitations, a max fee that is less than the whole quantity of gas required to complete your transaction will result in you losing your gas fee and having the transaction revoked.
<h3>Layer 2 scaling solutions</h3>
Finally, by communicating with the Ethereum blockchain via an Ethereum "layer 2 scaling solution," you may save money on gas. Scaling tools are Ethereum network enhancements that seek to speed up transactions and increase the number of transactions that may be handled per second. Arbitrum, Loopring, and dYdX are some well-known examples.

Layer 2 scaling solutions are off-chain, which means they process transactions independently of the Ethereum network. Despite the fact that layer 2 scaling solutions come in a variety of flavours, they all function in the same manner. Layer 2 transactions take place off-chain before being confirmed and recorded on-chain by the Ethereum network.

Returning to our total fee formula, layer 2 scaling solutions provide a means to save on gas by minimising the amount of gas units necessary to execute a transaction. Because this technique only communicates with Ethereum after the transaction is verified, Ethereum miners use less gas to conduct the interaction. Layer 2 solutions also help to reduce Ethereum network congestion, resulting in a cheaper total base price for all users. As a result, layer 2 scaling solutions might assist you in spending much less on gas.

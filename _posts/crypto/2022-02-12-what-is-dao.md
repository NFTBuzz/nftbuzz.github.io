A decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) is one that does not have a centralized leadership. Bottom-up decisions are made, regulated by a community organized around a certain set of rules enforced on a blockchain.

DAOs are internet-native organizations that are owned and governed jointly by its members. They have built-in treasuries that can only be accessed with the permission of their members. Decisions are made by suggestions that the group votes on over a certain period of time.

A DAO operates without hierarchical administration and may serve a variety of objectives. With these organizations, freelancer networks where contracts combine their earnings to pay for software subscriptions, philanthropic organizations where members authorise payments, and venture capital businesses managed by a group are all possibilities.

Before proceeding, it is necessary to differentiate between a DAO, an internet-native organization, and The DAO, one of the first such organizations ever founded. The DAO was a 2016 initiative that eventually collapsed, resulting in a catastrophic split in the Ethereum network.
<h2>How does a DAO work?</h2>
As previously stated, a DAO is an organization in which decisions are made from the bottom up; the organization is owned by a collective of members. There are many methods to engage in a DAO, the most common of which is via the ownership of a token.

DAOs use smart contracts, which are simply bits of code that run automatically when a set of conditions is satisfied. Smart contracts are being used on many blockchains, albeit Ethereum was the first to employ them.

The DAO's regulations are established by these smart contracts. Those who have a stake in a DAO may then vote and influence how the business functions by deciding on or introducing new governance ideas.

This methodology protects DAOs from being flooded with suggestions by requiring that a proposal be approved by a majority of stakeholders. The method for determining majority differs from DAO to DAO and is described in the smart contracts.

DAOs are completely self-sufficient and transparent. Because they are constructed on open-source blockchains, their code is accessible to everybody. Because the blockchain records all money transactions, anybody may audit their built-in treasuries.
<h2>Typically, a DAO launch occurs in three major steps</h2>
<strong>Smart contract creation:</strong> To begin, a developer or group of developers must construct the DAO's smart contract. They can only amend the rules imposed by these contracts after launch by using the governance system. That implies they must thoroughly examine the contracts to verify that key aspects are not overlooked.

<strong>Funding:</strong> Once the smart contracts are formed, the DAO must decide how to accept funding and how to implement governance. Tokens are often sold to generate cash; these tokens provide holders voting rights.

<strong>Deployment:</strong> Once everything is in place, the DAO must be placed on the blockchain. From this point on, stakeholders make decisions about the organization's future. The organization's founders — individuals who designed the smart contracts — no longer have as much influence over the endeavour as other stakeholders.
<h2>Why do we need DAOs?</h2>
DAOs offer significant benefits over conventional organizations since they are internet-native. The absence of trust required between two parties is a key benefit of DAOs. While a typical organization need a high level of confidence in the people behind it, particularly on the part of investors, DAOs require simply the code to be trusted.

Trusting that code is easy to accomplish since it is publicly accessible and can be thoroughly vetted before release. Every action taken by a DAO once it has been formed must be accepted by the community and be entirely open and verifiable.

There is no hierarchical structure in such an organization. Nonetheless, it may complete tasks and flourish while being governed by stakeholders via its native token. Because there is no hierarchy, any stakeholder may provide an original concept that the whole group will evaluate and improve upon. Internal conflicts are often simply resolved using the voting method in accordance with the pre-written rules in the smart contract.

DAOs let investors to pool their cash, enabling them to participate in early-stage enterprises and decentralized initiatives while sharing the risk and any gains that may result.
<h2>The principal-agent dilemma</h2>
The primary benefit of DAOs is that they provide a solution to the principal-agent problem. This quandary is caused by a clash of priorities between a person or organization (the primary) and others who make choices and act on their behalf (the agent).

Problems may arise in a variety of settings, the most typical of which being the interaction between stakeholders and a CEO. The agent (the CEO) may behave in their own self-interest rather than in accordance with the priorities and objectives established by the principal (the stakeholders).

Another common example of the principle-agent dilemma is when the agent takes on too much risk since the principal bears the burden. A trader, for example, might employ excessive leverage to pursue a performance bonus, knowing that the company would cover any loss.

The principal-agent problem is solved by DAOs via community governance. Stakeholders are not compelled to join a DAO and do so only after thoroughly comprehending the rules that govern it. They don't have to rely on any agent operating on their behalf and may instead operate as part of a group with aligned incentives.

The interests of token holders are aligned since the nature of a DAO incentivizes them not to be bad. They will want to see the network flourish because they have a vested interest in it. Acting against it would be a betrayal of their own self-interest.
<h2>What was The DAO?</h2>
The DAO was a forerunner of current decentralized autonomous organizations. It was founded in 2016 and was intended to be an automated organization that functioned as a kind of venture capital fund.

Those who held DAO tokens might profit from the organization's investments by receiving dividends or benefiting from token price gain. The DAO was once seen as a groundbreaking idea, and it garnered $150 million in Ether (ETH), making it one of the largest crowdfunding endeavours of the time.

On April 30, 2016, Ethereum protocol developer Christoph Jentzsch published open-source code for an Ethereum-based investment organization, resulting in the creation of the DAO. Investors purchased DAO tokens by transferring Ether to its smart contracts.

Some developers raised worry a few days into the token sale that a glitch in The DAO's smart contracts may enable unscrupulous actors to drain its cash. While a governance plan was being developed to address the flaw, an attacker exploited it and stole more than $60 million in ETH from The DAO's wallet.

At the time, The DAO received around 14 percent of all ETH in circulation. The attack dealt a serious blow to DAOs in general, as well as the one-year-old Ethereum network. As everyone tried to find out what to do, a discussion erupted among the Ethereum community. Initially, Vitalik Buterin, co-founder of Ethereum, advocated a soft fork that would ban the attacker's address and prohibit them from transferring the cash.

The attacker, or someone impersonating them, then reacted to that proposal, stating that the money were gained in a "legitimate" manner in accordance with the smart contract's terms. They said that they were prepared to sue anybody who attempted to seize the monies.

The hacker also promised to pay ETH miners with part of the stolen monies in order to prevent a soft fork. In the ensuing argument, a hard fork was found to be the answer. That hard fork was executed in order to revert the Ethereum network's history to before The DAO was hacked and reallocate the stolen cash to a smart contract that enabled investors to withdraw them. Those who opposed the move opposed the hard fork and backed an older version of the network known as Ethereum Classic (ETC).
<h2>Disadvantages of DAOs</h2>
Decentralized autonomous groups are not without flaws. They are a relatively new technology that has sparked considerable controversy because to remaining worries about their legality, security, and structure.

MIT Technology Review, for example, has said that trusting the people with critical financial choices is a terrible idea. While MIT revealed its opinions on DAOs in 2016, the institution does not seem to have altered its position – at least not publicly. The DAO attack also prompted security worries, since smart contract issues may be difficult to rectify even after they are discovered.

DAOs may exist in various countries, and there is no legal structure in place to govern them. Any legal concerns that may occur will very certainly need dealing with a plethora of regional laws in a complex court struggle.

For example, in July 2017, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission published a report determining that The DAO offered securities in the form of tokens on the Ethereum blockchain without permission, breaking elements of the country's securities legislation.
<h2>Examples of DAOs</h2>
Decentralized autonomous organizations have grown in popularity in recent years and are now completely integrated into several blockchain projects. DAOs, for example, are used in the decentralized finance (DeFi) field to enable applications to become truly decentralized.

According to some, the Bitcoin (BTC) network is the first example of a DAO. Even though most network users have never met, the network grows by community consensus. It also lacks a centralized governance framework, forcing miners and nodes to indicate their support.

However, by today's standards, Bitcoin is not considered a DAO. Dash would be the first real DAO by current standards, since the project features a governance structure that enables stakeholders to vote on the usage of its treasury.

Other, more sophisticated DAOs, such as decentralized networks based on the Ethereum blockchain, are in charge of developing cryptocurrency-backed stablecoins. In certain circumstances, the organizations that originally created these DAOs gradually relinquish control of the initiative, eventually becoming obsolete. Token holders may vote on governance proposals to recruit new contributors, add additional tokens as collateral for their currencies, or change other settings.

In 2020, a DeFi lending system introduced its own governance token, which was issued through a liquidity mining process. Essentially, everybody who participated with the system would be rewarded with tokens. The approach has now been adopted and altered by other projects.

Now, there is a long list of DAOs. It has evolved into a distinct notion that has gained traction through time. Some initiatives are currently attempting to achieve total decentralization through the DAO model, but it's worth noting that they are just a few years old and have yet to meet their ultimate aims and objectives.

DAOs, as internet-native organizations, have the ability to totally transform corporate governance. While the idea grows and the legal grey area in which they operate is addressed, an increasing number of organizations may adopt a DAO model to help manage parts of their operations.

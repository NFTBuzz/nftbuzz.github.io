<strong>Lifetime Royalties:</strong> Artists may earn money from their digital art tokens for the rest of their lives, not only when they sell them. You may integrate royalties into your digital artwork to get a part of the sales proceeds whenever the artwork is sold to a new user.

The proportion encoded into the artworks may vary from 2.5 percent to 10 percent, ensuring that you get interest on NFT art resales for the rest of your life.

<strong>Cheaper to Set Up:</strong> Setup is less expensive since the NFT art sale is handled online through numerous peer-to-peer markets to a worldwide audience, eliminating the need for auction houses and art galleries. This permits you to retain a significant share of the sales earnings.

<strong>Verifiable and Authentic:</strong> Although anybody may see, connect to, or download your digital artwork token, it is only held by one person at a time.

When it is added to the blockchain, it gains an unambiguous proof of authenticity since the creator, purchase price, and future owners and acquisition prices are all visible and travel with the artwork. This leads to a degree of market openness not before seen in the art industry.

The next part includes a thorough step-by-step tutorial on how to make NFT art.
<h2>How to Create NFT Art in 6 Simple Steps</h2>
You can create a digital art token by carefully following the steps below:
<h2>1. Select an NFT Marketplace</h2>
This is the very first stage in the process of making your NFT artwork. This peer-to-peer marketplace is divided into two categories, which are as follows:
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Curated Platforms:</strong> Only approved artists may mint or generate digital art tokens on this NFT marketplace category. They are mostly interested in high-quality digital art tokens rather than basic and low-quality trinkets.
SuperRare and other similar platforms are curated NFT markets. They charge greater transaction costs and provide less flexibility in terms of royalties rates that may be programmed into your artwork.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Self-Service Platforms:</strong> This peer-to-peer marketplace category enables anybody to establish their own NFT with anything they want. As a result, you may create your own using a picture, a video, or an audio file. It also lets you to choose the royalty percentage you want to charge for each token sale.
This category includes platforms such as OpenSea and Rarible. One danger connected with this kind of NFT marketplace is the presence of a large number of imitators and scammers.</li>
</ul>
After you've decided on a marketplace and created an account with them, it's time to go on to the next stage. However, since this post is intended for beginners, it will utilise the marketplace OpenSea as a case study to demonstrate how to establish your digital arts token.
<h2>2. Set Up a Digital Wallet</h2>
The next step is to build a digital wallet in which you will keep both your cryptocurrencies and your NFTs. Yes, cryptocurrencies, namely Ether, are required in the NFT formation process.

It would be advantageous if you possessed Ether, since numerous NFTs are generated on the Ethereum network. Before listing any cryptocurrency, you must pay the gas price, which is the Ethereum network transaction cost.

OpenSea often advises utilising the MetaMask cryptocurrency wallet's Google Chrome plugin to purchase ETH and prepare to mint NFTs.

Assume, however, that you already have another cryptocurrency wallet that contains ETH. In such situation, establish a Metamask wallet and move the ETH from your previous wallet to the MetaMask wallet.

It costs from $13 to $260 in ETH to pay for gas expenses when building an NFT. So, if your funds are available, go to the following stage.
<h2>3. Create Your Collection</h2>
At this time, you are not producing your digital arts token. My Collections will appear on the interface of your OpenSea account; click it. It functions as a digital arts shop or gallery.

You must now personalise your collection by giving it a name, creating a description, and uploading a display picture. This lays the basis for you to show your artworks after you've finished them.
<h2>4. Creating Your Digital Arts Token</h2>
Once your collection is complete, you may begin the main process of producing your NFT. When you click Add New Item, you will be given the choice to upload information, which includes visual (JPG, PNG, GIF, etc.), audio (MP3, etc.), and 3D assets (GLB, etc.), as well as giving your token a name.

You have the option of minting an infinite amount of tokens, but you must do so one at a time. It's also vital to consider how many versions of the same token you'd want to make.
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Stand-alone Token:</strong> This means that you can only make one duplicate of that specific digital art token, increasing its value.</li>
 	<li><strong>The Edition Tokens:</strong> In this section, you may make as many copies of the same token as you like. To identify between each duplicate, just add the edition number.</li>
</ul>
Following that, you may add attributes, levels, and metrics where applicable, since they allow customers who are browsing your collection to sort your artwork. Properties may include information such as the date the token was produced.

Once you've entered all of the essential information, such as social connections, an updated picture, a description, and a name, click "Create" to add your NFT to the blockchain. This step will need ETH to cover approval and gas costs.

Following that, you can choose the payment tokens that you want to accept for your digital work. You may also choose the proportion of royalties you want to earn from secondary sales of your artwork.
<h2>5. Listing Your Artwork For Sale</h2>
After you've built your NFTs, the following step is to put them up for sale. You may pick between a fixed-price listing and an auction, and you can choose your own pricing.

If this is your first time making and selling an NFT, you must pay a gas cost before advertising your artwork.
<h2>6. Promote Your Work On Social Media</h2>
You will need to acquire a large audience in order to increase your chances of selling your work. As a result, you must share your direct connection with prospective purchasers and market your artwork to admirers on social media in order for them to find it.

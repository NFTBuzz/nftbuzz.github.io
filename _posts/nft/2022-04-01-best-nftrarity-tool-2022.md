Non-fungible Tokens (NFTs) are sweeping the globe. However, it is not enough to have an NFT that you think looks good; it must also be uncommon, which influences the value of each NFT. If you want to invest in NFTs, you should utilise NFT rarity tools to assist you locate uncommon NFTs. In this article, we'll go over six of the top NFT rarity tools and what they can do for you!
<h2>What Makes an NFT Rare?</h2>
NFT rarity is a word that has been established to rate NFTs based on their uniqueness. Rarity is an important aspect in determining the value of NFTs. Understanding what makes an NFT unique allows you to find assets with higher potential value. So, what distinguishes an NFT? Here are a few examples:

<strong>Limited supply:</strong> If there are just a few of anything, it will be more sought after and hence more valuable. This is particularly true for digital materials, which may be endlessly duplicated and recreated. Issuers employ NFT rarity tools to monitor the amount of things created and guarantee that only a limited supply is accessible on markets such as OpenSea, Rare Bits, or Nifty. NFTs can be worth even more on open markets if they combine rarity and quality.

<strong>NFT attributes:</strong> This means that the NFT's digital DNA (or set of coded qualities) is distinct and recognisable. NFTs with uncommon characteristics will typically be more valued in open markets.

<strong>Special uses:</strong> NFT issuers may impose special limitations on their NFT goods, allowing only a fixed number of NFT users to profit from them. This results in NFTs that are more valuable than others since the number of people who can profit from them is limited.

<strong>Inherent demand:</strong> Some NFTs just have a higher demand than others. NFTs that reflect popular digital assets (such as Bitcoin or Ethereum) will, for example, be more desirable because people want to possess a share of those cryptocurrencies. NFTs used for gaming may have a greater intrinsic demand since players are always seeking for new and unusual things to add to their collections. NFTs used for social media reasons may also have a greater intrinsic demand since they are more appealing to consumers who wish to showcase their assets on a certain platform.

<strong>Historical context:</strong> Because of its historical context, an NFT may have a greater value at times. For example, if someone only used a certain NFT once in a game or on social media, it may be worth more because of its history. Outside of a game or social media, NFTs might have a historical background, such as limited edition NFTs based on original artwork.

<strong>Association with a celebrity:</strong> NFTs affiliated with a current or former celebrity are typically more valuable since they are one-of-a-kind.
<h2>How to Calculate an NFTs Rarity</h2>
Several formulae assist users in determining the rarity value of their NFTs. Among these formulas are:

Trait Rarity Ranking: This compares the rarest characteristics of each NFT, with the one with the lowest figure being the rarest.

Average Trait Rarity: The average value of the rare characteristics discovered in a specific NFT is calculated using this formula. Assuming an NFT had two qualities, one with a rarity of 20% and the other with a rarity of 30%, the average trait rarity would be (20+30)/2 = 25%.

Statistical Rarity: You may calculate an NFT's overall rarity by multiplying its trait rarities. As in the preceding example, the statistical rarity would be (20% * 30%) = 6%.

Rarity Score: The rarity score is thought to be the most accurate method of calculating rarity. Unlike trait tarity, which only examines the rarest trait, or statistical and average rarity, which fail to stress an NFT's single unusual characteristic, the rarity score provides a precise but balanced rating. As a result, it is the most often utilised rarity rating method in the NFT market.

According to rarity.com, here's how to determine the rarity of an NFT:

Rarity Score of a Trait Value = 1 / ([Number of Items That Have That Trait Value] / [Total Number of Items in Collection]).
<h2>Which NFT Rarity Tools Are Best for You?</h2>
Knowing the algorithms used to calculate rarity is insufficient to correctly determine how unique your NFT is. That is why you should be aware of some of the greatest tools for doing a rarity check. These programmes calculate all of the data for you and provide precise rankings so you know exactly what you're going to buy.

Here are some of the most effective NFT rarity tools.
<h3>1. Rarity.tools</h3>
One of the most popular NFT analysis tools is rarity.tools. This application is most recognised for rating the rarity of collectibles and art NFTs in real time. It rates some of the most successful NFTs, like Bored Ape Yacht Club, CryptoPunks, and VeeFriends.

When it comes to ranking, rarity.tools provides a rarity score to each NFT attribute. The total rarity score is calculated by adding all rarity scores. This allows you to easily access and rapidly check scores for any listed NFTs.

It's also simple to add generative art and collectible NFTs to rarity.tools. Creators pay a set fee of 2 ETH to list an NFT, however all users get free analysis services. Aside from that, this application provides information on impending NFT sales and keeps you up to date on market trends.

Despite being the greatest NFT rarity tool, rarity.tools does have a few drawbacks. For starters, the 2 ETH charge for inventors is rather high. Second, despite its basic style, the site lacks navigational tabs, making it difficult for first-time visitors to look for current and high-ranking NFTs.
<h3>2. Cryptoslam</h3>
Cryptoslam is an NFT data aggregator. It shows worldwide indexes, fan tokens, blockchain sales, all-time NFT project rankings, and the best sales for NFT collectibles based on volume, making it an excellent NFT tool. Furthermore, it presents all of information on a single landing page, making it simple for novices to do their study. This tool will also provide you with information about a certain NFT, such as pricing, distinctive characteristics, and rarity rankings.

In addition, the gadget provides information about NBA Top Shot. You may quickly search for videos of your favourite teams or players, look up the names of the individuals who own them, and get their wallet addresses if you wish to purchase. If you're searching for a basic NFT tool, these capabilities make Cryptslam worth a look.
<h3>3. Opensea</h3>
Opensea is the world's most popular NFT marketplace. It has a large collection of digital assets from the Polygon, Ethereum, and Klaytn blockchains. It uses smart contracts to govern NFT ownership and offers features that allows individuals to monitor, curate, and trade NFTs in one easy platform; it also gives real-time information on everything that is occurring in Opensea's market.

The NFT ranking feature in Openseas provides users with NFT ranks based on volume as well as other statistical variables such as floor price. So, although you may see NFT characteristics and the rarity of each trait, the site may not be able to give you an NFT's rarity score or even its total rarity rank.
<h3>4. Rarity Sniper</h3>
NFT rarity has never been easier to find than on Rarity Sniper. This well-known tool has over 870 NFT datasets from major blockchains such as Solana and Ethereum. Rarity Sniper is an easy-to-use interface that displays all of your token's qualities, rarity ratings, and rankings.

Another significant advantage of utilising Rarity Sniper is that you may use its Discord channels to determine the rarity of your NFT. This is a more streamlined method of doing your rarity check. Regrettably, it restricts you to the NFT collections supported by Rarity Sniper.
<h3>5. Moby.gg</h3>
Moby is a real-time NFT analysis tool that provides a simple and transparent rarity rating. It provides a variety of ranks, including NFT attributes, markets, and mints. All of this is meticulously placed at the top of the landing page, making it simple to navigate. Moby provides six months of access to real-time data, warnings for wallets and popular mints, a repository of historical data, and live graphs that run real-time updates for 0.1 ETH.

Moby also displays all current transactions, including presales. Knowing an NFT's presale performance is an excellent approach to estimate its popularity and if it's worth purchasing. Despite these advantages, Moby.gg falls short in one critical area: data display. The material on the site is not presented fully at once on your screen. While such a layout reduces the size of the page, it is inconvenient to have to browse numerous pages for little amounts of information.
<h3>6. Traitsniper</h3>
Traitsniper is another excellent rare tool that provides up-to-date information on forthcoming NFT projects. Traitsniper employs a bot to calculate the rarity of the NFT as soon as a new project is created. The tool is available in both a free and a premium edition. The premium version guarantees that you get real-time updates for various NFTs as soon as they enter the market.

However, you may be dismayed by how crowded the location is. Traitsniper, in particular, might be difficult to use for novice users. Nonetheless, if you click on a certain NFT, its Rarity Rank and score will be shown. You will also see the price of the NFT and the maximum offer it has gotten on Opensea.
<h2>Get Your NFT Rarity Ratings Right Before Investing</h2>
Investing in NFTs may be a profitable and fascinating venture. Remember, when it comes to getting the most bang for your buck in any collectible market, rarity reigns supreme! The more uncommon an object is, the more valuable it will be on the secondary market. So, if you want to start investing in NFTs, these NFT rarity tools will help you find the greatest rare NFTs on the market.

As of 2021, the NFT business was worth $41 billion – only $9 billion less than the actual art market produced in 2020. As the demand for non-fungible tokens grows, it's feasible that the NFT market may one day match, if not exceed, the value of conventional art. Of course, there are several obstacles that NFTs must face before that occurs, one of which is determining how to show them.

Physical artworks are simple to display. Simply frame and display them over a fireplace, in a gallery, or on an easel. However, in the case of NFTs, makers and collectors may find it difficult to display their collections. So what’s the solution?
<h2>Print your NFT</h2>
If you want to display your still-image NFTs for the least amount of money, you can print them like any other picture. You may also include a QR code that can be scanned for confirmation or purchase. Simply put the URL linked with your NFT artwork into a QR-code generating site such as Scanova or QRCode Monkey. The website will produce a QR code once you paste the URL.

If you're not sure what kind of paper, print size, or finish to use for your NFTs, businesses like Solid can assist. These companies use cutting-edge technology to give their customers with high-definition NFT printing services. There's no need to be concerned about canvas size, frame quality, print longevity, or texture. The NFT printing provider handles everything, and your actual NFT is delivered to your home in a timely and hassle-free way.

All that remains is for you to choose an ideal location for displaying your artwork.
<h2>Digital NFT frames</h2>
Digital NFT display frames may be the trendiest method to present your artwork. While printed NFTs can only display still pictures, digital displays may show NFTs in the form of movies or GIFs. Tokenframe is one digital frame alternative. These frames include an anti-glare display, dual speakers, and an auto-rotating feature. Furthermore, since these digital frames are controlled by your smartphone, you can effortlessly switch between many NFTs and their associated QR codes on the same frame.

Atomic Form, a Web3 media startup, got the (CES) innovation award in January 2022 for their 4K NFT display - Atomic Form Wave. This cutting-edge digital NFT frame is linked to the user's crypto wallet and validates each NFT on the blockchain before displaying it. Users may also use the Wave device on Atomic Form Hub to share, manage, and lend their NFTs to one another.

Atomic Form states in a press release that "The Wave has also been battle-tested at The Gateway where we concurrently employed 50 units and the software has been battle-tested at Phillips for Slime Sunday as well as Christie's (Justin Aversano) and the Pellas Gallery in Boston." Atomic Form recently announced that a new version of the Wave F2 will be introduced in March, with pre-sale participants receiving a "special edition" of the company's newest NFT display.

Infinite Objects, a firm that produces electricity-powered display frames for video NFTs, is another participant aiming to introduce NFTs into the real world. To get your video NFT, you must first submit the file to the Infine Object website. Then, depending on the style of frame you choose, you pay between $79 to $450+, and your NFT arrives within a few weeks.

You also don't have to worry about your film being cut off since the frames from Infinite Objects can sustain videos that last up to 24 hours. Furthermore, if you own an NBA Top Shot NFT, you will get an authentication certificate in addition to your printed NFT. They accept cryptocurrency payments such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, and USDC.

The NFT display business, like the NFT industry, is rapidly developing, therefore Tokenframe, Atomic Form, and Infinite Objects aren't the only firms offering digital NFT display frames. If you don't want to spend hundreds of dollars on a beautiful digital frame, multi-functional devices like the Samsung QLED HDR Smart TV are a good alternative. When you're not watching Netflix, you may utilise the TV's "Art Mode" feature to show your NFTs or other artworks.
<h2>Display your NFT collection online</h2>
Marketplaces like as OpenSea, Raribe, Nifty Gateway, and SuperRare have also contributed to the success of NFTs. Millions of purchasers visit these NFT markets every day, and they provide the majority of the NFT industry's income. As a result, they are an excellent alternative for showcasing your digital art collection.

Aside buying online markets, you may also check display websites like as Showtime, Collectors Hub, and Lazy, where artists and collectors often show their NFTs. If you already have a sizable following on social media platforms such as Discord and Twitter, you may establish your own NFT art website.

Finally, a private website or portfolio enables you to exhibit and sell your NFTs anyway you see fit. You are not required to obey any unfavourable terms and conditions, and you are not subject to any marketplace fees or limitations.
<h2>Display your NFT collection in the metaverse</h2>
NFTs are multidimensional assets with a presence that extends beyond online markets and digital frames. In the metaverse, virtual worlds have their own art galleries or locations that are ideal for showing NFTs. For example, in Decentraland and Sandbox, users may purchase digital land on which to host an NFT art show event (or exhibition) and invite other users.

You may arrange art exhibits, auctions, and other events to showcase, promote, or sell your NFT collection after you've joined up and acquired virtual land. You may even make unique passes and tickets for such events and distribute them over social media.

However, if you are a new artist and platforms such as Decentraland are too expensive for you, you may use Cyber, where users can freely show their NFTs. Obviously, foot traffic in such less popular places is limited, but they are ideal for presenting immersive NFT art shows and drawing your own audience.

These other NFT display systems have the ability to bridge the digital art business with the real world. They may assist expose NFTs to audiences that would not otherwise be aware of the web3 advancements. NFT displays, with their distinct aesthetic appeal, are also anticipated to boost public adoption of blockchain technology.

NFT is the new buzzword. Popularized in 2021 with cryptocurrency enthusiasts, non-fungible tokens are about to enter other sectors, including video games. We tell you everything you need to know about this controversial technology.

Since the beginning of last year, we have often heard about NFT. Regularly, celebrities invest colossal sums in what is all too often presented as simple JPG images representing computer-generated characters. For example, the famous rapper Eminem bought an NFT from the Bored Ape Yacht Club collection for the sum of 450,000 dollars.

Presented as simple images sold at a high price, NFTs can make you smile. Despite the strong media coverage of the phenomenon, many Internet users are indeed struggling to understand the interest of NFTs, and the underlying revolution that accompanies them and which prefigures the future of the Internet (the famous Web 3.0). We take stock of this abstract and thorny subject below.

An NFT refers to a digital file to which a digital certificate of authenticity has been attached. More exactly, the NFT is a cryptographic token stored on a blockchain . The digital file alone is fungible, whether it is a photo, video or otherwise, the associated NFT is non-fungible. The first NFT was created in 2014, but NFTs didn't really hit the mainstream until 2017, when the Ethereum platform gained momentum. It is on this blockchain that the CrytoPunks and CryptoKitties projects (using NFTs) were born. In 2021, the work Everydays - The First 5000 Days, by artist Mike Winkelmann, better known as Beeple, sold for $69.3 million. It is the most expensive piece of digital art in history to date.
<h2>What is an NFT used for?</h2>
An NFT makes a digital file unique. In fact, when you buy an NFT you buy exclusive ownership of the original work included in this NFT. However, the artist retains his copyright and reproduction rights. The buyer acquires certain rights such as publishing the work online. An NFT can be associated with:
<ul>
 	<li>digital painting;</li>
 	<li>a video, such as NBA Top Shot basketball videos ;</li>
 	<li>A meme; a photograph ;</li>
 	<li>a collector's item, a card for example;</li>
 	<li>a video game element (avatars, skins), such as those of Cryptokitties ;</li>
 	<li>a ticket for an event, such as a concert;</li>
 	<li>a movie ;</li>
 	<li>a patent ;</li>
 	<li>a virtual object that can be used in a virtual world with a virtual reality headset, such as a pair of designer shoes; an audio file, or even a whole musical album like " When you see yourself " by the group King of Leon.</li>
</ul>
For an artist, an NFT makes it possible to sell a digital file as he would sell a physical work. For a buyer, the NFT makes it possible to support an artist, collect digital works of art and speculate on these works.
<h2>How does NFT Works?</h2>
To attest to the uniqueness of an NFT, it must be digitized and registered on the blockchain. Currently, a large portion of non-fungible tokens is registered on the Ethereum blockchain.

At the origin of most cryptocurrencies on the market, the blockchain is a decentralized ledger that keeps track of everything that is entered into it. Unlike a more traditional database, the blockchain is immutable, unalterable and inviolable. When creating an NFT, all the data of work will be digitized and entered into the blockchain. A non-fungible token can contain a large amount of information.

Technologies also make it possible to combine a host of data, ranging from images to lines of code, including video. Once registered in the blockchain, the work will be accompanied by a digital certificate of authenticity. This certificate guarantees that the Internet user in its possession is indeed the sole and unique owner of an NFT. Once digitized on the blockchain, the history of the work (purchases, resales, date of creation, name of the creator, etc.) is recorded forever. This is why auction houses specializing in Art, such as Christie's or Sotheby's, quickly appropriated the technology behind NFTs.
<h3>How to create an NFT?</h3>
To transform a digital file into NFT, Minting consists of copying a digital file to a server and then creating a cryptographic token containing a link to this file on a blockchain. The creator of the original work can also store any information in the metadata of the NFT, such as his name.
<h3>The use of blockchain</h3>
NFTs are based on blockchain technology. A blockchain is a decentralized and secure database that stores the history of all operations. In addition to various cryptocurrencies, some blockchains may issue non-fungible tokens. This is the case of Ethereum, Solana or Binance for example. We can thus know who owns this or that NFT. Creating an NFT is not free. Costs specific to the blockchain used are to be paid and can vary from a few cents to more than a hundred euros.
<h3>How to sell an NFT?</h3>
NFTs are offered for sale on dedicated platforms. super rare, Raible and OpenSea are among the most popular. These platforms offer the advantage of being able to directly create an NFT from any digital file. The NFT is then sold as a work of art, either at a fixed price decided by the seller or at auction. Notably, each time an NFT is resold, the artist earns a small commission.
<h4>SHOULD YOU INVEST IN AN NFT?</h4>
Holders of a non-fungible token do not hesitate to present these as excellent investments. By speculating on the price of certain flagship collections, some Internet users manage to get rich, or at least make impressive profits in cryptocurrencies.

However, keep in mind that making money from NFTs is not as easy as one would like to believe. Indeed, the price of all digital works does not increase automatically. By investing in an NFT, you always take the risk of not recovering your initial stake. For one reason or another, the price of the good may go down and never go up again. This is true for NFTs, cryptocurrencies, stocks or real estate.
<h4>WHY DO NFTS SO OFTEN AROUSE MISTRUST, ESPECIALLY AMONG GAMERS?</h4>
Many video game publishers have shown interest in NFTs. More and more studios want to offer skins or items in the form of non-fungible tokens to their players. In December, Ubisoft also announced the launch of Quartz, a platform for acquiring NFTs. This platform offers non-fungible tokens for use in the game Ghost Recon Breakpoint .

This initiative angered the players. Faced with criticism, Ubisoft was forced to remove the presentation video from its YouTube channel. Many players indeed sum up NFTs to speculation and trading in digital works and believe that publishers are simply trying to get rich on their backs. In addition, some video game fans point to the colossal energy consumption of cryptocurrencies and blockchains that allow NFTs to be exchanged. By adopting NFTs, they believe that publishers are endangering the environment.

Under these conditions, they take a very dim view of the implementation of NFTs in their favourite video games. The ferocity of critics of NFTs has already caused several companies in the sector to change their minds. This is especially the case with Discord. The popular messaging application among gamers has finally chosen not to add support for NFTs to its platform following the outcry of its user community. Even so, many companies, including Square Enix, continue to proclaim their interest in the technology.

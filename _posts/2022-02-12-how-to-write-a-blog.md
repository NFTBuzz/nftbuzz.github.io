The following statements do not constitute investment advice or any other advice on financial services, financial instruments, financial products or digital assets. They are intended to provide general information. The following statements do not constitute an offer to enter into a contract to buy or sell financial instruments and financial products or an invitation to submit such an offer and to buy or sell a digital asset. Cryptocurrencies are subject to strong fluctuations in value. A decline in value or total loss is possible at any time. Loss of access to data and passwords can also lead to complete loss.

But what exactly is an NFT? Another rather opaque acronym at first glance. NFT comes from the English Non Fungible Token or non-fungible token.  
NFTs are new and fascinating. These are unique digital goods, in circulation since 2014, whose transactions are made in cryptocurrency. Used to indicate ownership of a digital object (often a digital work of art), these tokens are disrupting markets around the world, from art and video games to events and insurance.
Still can't see it clearly? It's normal, the subject is complex! That's why we've put together this article to help you better understand NFTs. Follow the leader !

What does NFT mean?
NFT stands for non-fungible token. Let's start at the beginning: what does non-fungible mean? The adjective “fungible” is an economic term that refers to a good or an asset that can be exchanged for another good or another asset of the same value. For example, a dollar bill is fungible because it can easily be exchanged for another dollar bill of the same value.
A "non-fungible" item cannot be exchanged for something of equal value. A plot of land is non-fungible, since each piece of land has its own characteristics, and finding another plot with exactly the same value is difficult, if not impossible. Art is another example of a non-fungible asset, since its value is highly subjective. This is where NFTs come in.
An NFT guarantees exclusive ownership of a digital asset (for example, that of a work of art, a purchase in a video game, or a tweet - yes, a tweet!). You can buy an NFT at a certain price, but the fact that it is non-fungible allows its market value to fluctuate.
How do NFTs work? Are they a cryptocurrency?
Although NFT transactions are mostly done in cryptocurrencies (bitcoin, Ethereum, etc.), they are not cryptocurrencies themselves . Like dollars and other currencies, cryptocurrencies are fungible. If you exchange one bitcoin for another bitcoin, both will have the same value. And you will always have a bitcoin of the same value in your wallet. Since NFTs are unique, they have no equivalent value and are subject to market volatility.

What do you actually get when you buy an NFT?
Since an NFT can only have one owner at a time, when you buy an NFT, you are buying sole ownership of a digital asset. This doesn't mean you have exclusive rights to who can view or share your work.
Take for example the highest-selling NFT to date, American artist Beeple's Everydays: The First 5000 Days , which depicts a 5,000-piece digital collage. The owner of this NFT is Vignesh Sundaresan, founder of Metapurse and the bitcoin distributor network, BitAccess.
Although Mr. Sundaresan is the official owner of this NFT, this image has been copied, shared and seen by millions of people all over the world without any compensation. Buying an NFT is like buying an autographed work. The signature of the NFT is addressed to you, but anyone can see the work.

Any digital asset can become an NFT. Since the introduction of NFTs, we have seen:
works of art
tweets
GIFs
songs
video game purchases
tests
domain names
Why would you want to buy an NFT?
The more you seek to penetrate the strange and fascinating universe of non-fungible tokens, the more you could try to understand the value of owning them. There are several reasons to invest in it.
Scarcity
There's nothing like rarity to increase excitement around an item. Indeed, an NFT can only have one owner. Potential buyers thus set their sights on a particular property and buy it before someone else becomes the exclusive owner.
Think of a website that tells you that there is only one left of the pair of sneakers you absolutely want. Most of the time, this creates an excitement that encourages you to make your purchase, even if it is not carefully thought out .
The art of collecting
The same way baseball cards are traded at recess, NFTs are trading cards for the very wealthy. Although there is no inherent value in these cards other than what the market assigns to them, their fluctuating value makes their possession and tradability a high-risk game of chance. It is then easy to make comparisons between NFTs and the art market.
However, unlike the art market, NFTs give more autonomy to artists, who no longer depend on galleries or auction houses to sell their works. By cutting out the middleman, artists can sell their works directly to buyers and keep more of the profits.

Is it a good deal to invest in non-fungible tokens?
Aimed primarily at investors who like to take risks, NFTs offer a unique opportunity to make considerable profits. But be aware that this rarely happens! Although less cool and trendy, if you're looking for a more reliable way to invest your money, consider index funds rather than a rainbow cat GIF.
If you want to take the plunge, however, and enter the world of non-fungible tokens, you'll need to start by opening a digital wallet . It will be used to store your crypto currencies and your NFTs. Then you will have to search for NFTs on OpenSea.io or Rarible, find one you like, buy the cryptocurrency that will allow you to buy it and make your purchase.
Then you just have to wait. Since the value of your NFT depends on how much someone else is willing to pay for it, you and your Pop-Tart cat are at the mercy of the market.
